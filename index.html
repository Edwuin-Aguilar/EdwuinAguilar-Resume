        <div class="subheading mb-5">Business Administration📚</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">I have amazing team working, problem-solving, and time management skills that would be useful in this position. Apart from this, I'm also trilingual speaking English, Spanish, and French. My past working experiences include being a tutor at the Bresee Youth Foundation, where I would be in charge of reviewing class material with students by discussing the text, working solutions to problems, or reviewing worksheets or other assignments. As a result of this, I believe that I have the essential skills to fill the veterinary position. The reason is that my past experiences show that I was able to be in charge of situations where I was the one that had to work out solutions and problems which means that I'm able to take on challenges to make sales which makes me the perfect candidate as I have the experience and knowledge for the position. 
<br><br>

        Apart from this, I have always loved animals ever since a kid so this has been a passion for me for a while now. I have had experience with pets before being the pets I have owned shows that I have experiences with animals. Apart from this I have also visited many vets and seen how they work with animals to do their objectives and take care of them. Through this, I was able to see what they are supposed to do with animals. Seeing this not only showed me some things that I might need but it also showed me the steps that I will have to do and only further increase the reason why I want to be a vet as I want to help animals. During the time that I saw how vets work I saw how great they were I saw the passion that they had towards the animal and how everything they did was careful though study and to benefit the animal. Apart from this, I saw the vets communicate with the owners and let them know what their pets might have and see how they prescribe them things that they might need to get better. These are the things that I witness when shadowing a vet and I believe that all of this is very important for me to have learned.
<br><br>

        Being able to care for animals is the main reason why I want to pursue a career as a vet. Having had animals in the past I know that there are many health issues that they have and if not taken care of they lead to horrible things. I have seen many pets get diseases that are fatal and because of that, it has made me want to be a vet because my dog died from one of these diseases. After all, it was really hard to get treated. As a result of that moment, I knew that I wanted to help pets as I didn’t want any other animal to suffer as much as he did because of what he had. Not only this but I also don’t want any owners of animals to have to deal with the loss of their pet because it’s not an easy one to deal with.
